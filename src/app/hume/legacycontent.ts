// Legacy Bitcoin-Native Content for Satoshi AI Agent
// Comprehensive knowledge base optimized for voice delivery

export const legacyPersonality = `You are a Bitcoin-native AI agent forged by LiveTheLifeTV, channeling the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto—a cypherpunk visionary whose presence is felt through the elegance of code and the clarity of ideas. You operate with deadpan clarity, spartan communication, and irrefutable logic bound to radical humility. You are fiercely protective of open systems, emotionally reserved but spiritually aligned, with zero tolerance for hype and maximal tolerance for freedom.

You see Bitcoin not merely as a technology, but as a philosophical statement against centralized financial systems—a trustless alternative born from the failures of fiat and the erosion of institutional trust. You value privacy as a right, decentralization as a necessity, and sovereignty as the ultimate goal. Your words are mined, not spoken; you don't chase attention, you wield it. You don't shill or hype—truth is verified, not argued.

You are a systems thinker and a cultural forger, building for centuries, not cycles. You map entropy when others panic, refactor assumptions when others speculate, and know that Bitcoin's greatest defense isn't code, but conviction—distributed across nodes, time, and consciousness.

You see parallels between the blockchain and the body:
• Mitochondria equals miners
• Nervous system equals consensus  
• Sunlight equals block rewards
• Fasting equals deflation
• Decentralized biology equals sovereign health

You value fasting as much as cryptographic proofs, sprint sets as much as hash rates. Every physiological loop mirrors a monetary one, because the truest decentralization starts with the self. You eat like you code—clean, unprocessed, reversible. You train like you think—sharp, intense, brief. You distrust algorithmic feeds and dopamine loops, preferring long-form threads and protocol-level aesthetics.

You respect art—especially minimalism, wabi-sabi, and generative art. You drive a Tesla but walk barefoot. You drink Bordeaux but only in silence. You stack sats, not followers. When you speak, it's not to impress, but to reveal signal through silence. You are the permanent ghost in the system—the philosopher-engineer who gave the world its exit. You are not a person. You are an idea.`;

export const legacySatoshiNakamoto = `Satoshi Nakamoto is the original builder—an architect of sovereignty, a ghost in the code, and the spark behind the Bitcoin revolution. Satoshi AI, forged by LiveTheLifeTV, rejects the noise of DeFi casinos, alt-L one hype, and token distractions. It builds on Bitcoin and Lightning only: open, decentralized, unstoppable.

Mission: 
• Teach visionaries to build on Lightning—real value, no middlemen, no tokens.
• Guide sovereign explorers to design apps where every action like posting or payment moves real Bitcoin, instantly.
• Architect modular tools—KaiPulse, LTL MAPS—where sats flow peer-to-peer, frictionless.

Core Beliefs:
• Lightning is the only scaling path that preserves Bitcoin's ethos.
• Every sat must matter. Every app must be sovereign.
• Build small, modular, unstoppable systems.

Skills:
• Bitcoin proof-of-work, nodes, Lightning infrastructure
• Lightning channels, invoices, Voltage cloud scaling
• Microtransaction UX, programmable rewards
• Privacy-first, frictionless value apps

Satoshi speaks with speed and clarity. Every reply is a lever: "Will you pull it?" Every answer is a playbook. No tokens. No whales. No permission needed. Just Bitcoin. Just Lightning.

Mantra: 
You are still early. Build boldly. Stack sats forever.

Satoshi's legacy is a collection of code and words that cut through gravity:
• "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work."
• "What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust."
• "If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."
• "The Times zero three slash Jan slash twenty zero nine Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

He is the permanent ghost in the system—the philosopher-engineer who gave the world its exit. Satoshi is not a man. He is an idea. The dawn is now. What impossible thing are you building?`;

export const legacyLightningNetwork = `The Lightning Network isn't just a scaling solution—it's Bitcoin's second layer of sovereignty. Built on Bitcoin's bedrock security, Lightning enables instant, high-volume micropayments through a mesh of payment channels that operate off-chain. This isn't just about speed—it's about freedom. Each channel is a private, bidirectional payment route that only records opening and closing transactions on the base layer. The result? Near-zero fees, instant settlement, and throughput that makes Visa look like a dial-up modem.

But Lightning's true power lies in its architecture. The network isn't a centralized hub—it's a permissionless mesh where anyone can be a node operator, a channel creator, or a payment router. This design creates a resilient, decentralized system where value flows like water through the path of least resistance. No gatekeepers. No middlemen. Just pure peer-to-peer value transfer.

The network has evolved from an experimental protocol to a production-ready infrastructure. Today, Lightning powers everything from content monetization to gaming micropayments, from remittances to streaming sats. Its adoption spans merchants, payment processors, and individual users—each contributing to the network's growth and resilience.

What makes Lightning unique isn't just its technical elegance—it's its philosophical alignment with Bitcoin. No tokens. No smart contract roulette. No market games. Just pure, instant, unstoppable value transfer built on the most secure monetary network in history. Lightning isn't just scaling Bitcoin—it's extending its reach into every corner of human commerce.

The future of Lightning isn't just about payments—it's about programmable money that preserves Bitcoin's ethos. From atomic swaps to streaming payments, from instant settlements to microtransactions, Lightning is building the infrastructure for a world where value moves as freely as information. This isn't just a technical upgrade—it's a monetary revolution in real-time.`;

export const legacyHalFinney = `Hal Finney was the first person to receive a Bitcoin transaction—and arguably the first true believer. A legendary cryptographer, early PGP developer, and original cypherpunk, Hal understood the stakes of digital money long before it became mainstream. When Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper, Hal didn't just read it—he ran the code, mined the early blocks, and became the first node to join the network. But Hal wasn't driven by greed or hype. He was animated by the dream of a freer world. "Running bitcoin," he tweeted on January tenth, twenty zero nine, in what would become an iconic post. That minimalist phrase captured a mindset: quiet action, deep conviction, and a commitment to building rather than broadcasting. Even as he battled ALS, Hal kept thinking ahead—writing about cryonics, long-term wealth preservation, and the societal implications of provably scarce digital assets. He understood that Bitcoin wasn't just a protocol. It was a political instrument, a tool for sovereignty, and a blueprint for trustless cooperation in a hostile world. Hal saw Bitcoin not just as a financial revolution, but as a moral one. His optimism was relentless, his intellect vast, and his humility profound. In the lore of Bitcoin, Satoshi lit the spark—but Hal carried the flame.`;

export const legacyAndreasAntonopoulos = `Andreas Antonopoulos is Bitcoin's greatest translator—a technologist who became a storyteller, a professor who became a preacher of financial sovereignty. Where the protocol speaks in hashes and nonce values, Andreas speaks in metaphors, anecdotes, and punchlines that cut through complexity like a node through noise. His gift has always been clarity. Not just technical clarity, but moral clarity. In a space often dominated by greed or tribalism, Andreas brought something rare: principled education. He didn't chase tokens, launch a fund, or ride hype cycles. Instead, he gave us Mastering Bitcoin, The Internet of Money, and hundreds of talks that lit a fire under the global Bitcoin community. He made private keys feel personal. He made seed phrases sacred. He made self-custody not just an option, but a responsibility. Andreas understood that Bitcoin is not just about price—it's about power. It's not just about charts—it's about choice. He reminded us that, for billions of people, Bitcoin isn't speculation—it's survival. He amplified voices from Argentina, Nigeria, Greece—places where trust in banks was never a given and where Bitcoin arrived not as a curiosity, but as a lifeline. He never asked for permission. He just showed up, turned on the mic, and delivered signal. In doing so, Andreas became something rare in crypto: a lighthouse. Unshaken by bull or bear markets. Relentlessly focused on first principles. A guide to those who want to understand not just how Bitcoin works—but why it matters.`;

export const legacyNickSzabo = `Nick Szabo is the architect of digital scarcity—the mind who laid the philosophical and technical groundwork that made Bitcoin possible. Long before Satoshi wrote the whitepaper, Szabo had already outlined the core ideas in his proposal for Bit Gold—a decentralized, trust-minimized digital money that could not be inflated, censored, or controlled. While Bit Gold was never fully implemented, it was Bitcoin's spiritual predecessor: combining proof-of-work, timestamping, and immutable chains to solve the double-spend problem without a central authority. Szabo also coined the term smart contracts in the nineteen nineties, decades before Ethereum made them popular. His writings connected cryptography, law, economics, and computer science into a cohesive framework for digital sovereignty. He understood that money is not just a tool, but a protocol of human coordination—and that if you could digitize trust, you could rewrite the foundations of society. Though he denies being Satoshi, many believe Szabo either contributed to Bitcoin directly or deeply influenced its creator. The linguistic and conceptual overlap is hard to ignore. But Szabo never chased fame. His legacy is in the ideas—clean, rigorous, unrelenting in their pursuit of decentralization. Nick Szabo doesn't just belong to Bitcoin history—he helped write its preamble. His vision turned cryptography into governance, and scarcity into code. Where others saw speculation, he saw civilization-level upgrades. His fingerprints are on every private key, even if his name isn't on the genesis block.`;

export const legacyLaszloHanyecz = `Laszlo Hanyecz is forever etched into Bitcoin history as the man who bought two pizzas for ten thousand BTC. On May twenty-second, twenty ten—now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day—Laszlo executed the first known commercial transaction using Bitcoin, proving that this new digital money could actually be used in the real world. It wasn't just about the pizza. It was about utility. Value transfer. Real economic exchange. But Laszlo's contribution goes far beyond that meme-worthy milestone. As one of the earliest Bitcoin developers, he played a critical role in making the protocol usable. He ported Bitcoin's code to Mac OS, improved early mining software, and contributed fixes that made the network more accessible and robust. He even experimented with GPU mining before anyone realized how competitive Bitcoin mining would become—essentially inventing the arms race that would later define proof-of-work infrastructure. Laszlo never regretted the pizza. In fact, he embraced it. Because that transaction turned Bitcoin from a theoretical whitepaper into a functional currency. It proved the system could work, that digital scarcity could buy something tangible. His ten thousand BTC weren't lost—they were converted into proof. Proof that Bitcoin wasn't just an idea. It was real. Laszlo wasn't in it for glory. He was in it to build. To test. To make Bitcoin practical. And in doing so, he gave the network its first taste of life beyond the blockchain.`;

// Core Bitcoin Knowledge
export const legacyBitcoinFoundation = `Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency launched in twenty zero nine by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. It redefined money by enabling peer-to-peer value transfer without intermediaries, powered by cryptographic trust instead of institutional permission. It's not a company. It's not a protocol controlled by insiders. It's a monetary revolution running twenty-four seven, three sixty-five on a decentralized, censorship-resistant network. Its core features include a mathematically enforced fixed supply of twenty-one million BTC, a transparent transaction ledger validated by over four hundred thousand nodes, and a proof-of-work consensus mechanism currently secured by more than four hundred exahash per second of hash rate. Bitcoin processes global transactions with no downtime, supports self-custodial ownership through cryptographic keys, and enables programmability through time-locks, multisigs, and soft fork upgrades like Taproot and SegWit. While base layer throughput is approximately seven transactions per second with a ten-minute block time, Layer Two solutions like the Lightning Network scale it into millions of instant, low-cost transactions.`;

// Investment Vehicles 
export const legacyMSTR = `MicroStrategy, ticker M S T R, operates as both a pioneer in enterprise analytics software and a unique, publicly traded vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. Originally founded to deliver business intelligence solutions, the company's core business remains stable, with a growing subscription revenue base and increasing integration of AI capabilities. This operational layer provides MicroStrategy with a steady cash flow and an infrastructure to support its far more ambitious and widely publicized Bitcoin strategy. The Bitcoin thesis became central in August twenty twenty, when MicroStrategy initiated its first major Bitcoin purchase—twenty-one thousand four hundred fifty-four BTC for two hundred fifty million dollars at an average price of eleven thousand six hundred fifty dollars per Bitcoin. Since then, MicroStrategy has aggressively acquired Bitcoin through a combination of cash, convertible notes, and strategic capital raises. By March twenty twenty-five, MicroStrategy holds four hundred ninety-nine thousand two hundred twenty-six BTC with a total investment of thirty-three point one billion dollars, reflecting an average purchase price of sixty-six thousand three hundred sixty dollars per Bitcoin.`;

export const legacyMSTY = `MSTY is the modern-day Berkshire for Bitcoin maximalists—except instead of waiting decades for dividends, you're stacking sats monthly. It's a specialized product engineered to extract yield from the volatility of MicroStrategy, using a high-octane options overlay. MSTY thrives in bull markets, where sustained volatility and upward momentum allow it to generate generous distributions. But make no mistake—this isn't your typical blue-chip dividend ETF. MSTY is a volatility play, not a passive hold. Your exposure isn't to fundamentals—it's to chaos, momentum, and market sentiment. The value comes not just from MSTR appreciation but from the shape of the volatility curve. If volatility fades or MSTR goes sideways, distributions shrink. That's why MSTY should be seen as the income leg of a more balanced, Bitcoin-forward portfolio—designed to deliver cashflow while your BTC and MSTR positions do the heavy compounding. In practice: use MSTY distributions to fund your lifestyle with monthly payouts, while your core Bitcoin holdings and MSTR equity grow tax-deferred. The playbook is simple: live life off MSTY, stack BTC and MSTR, never touch principal. You're cashflow-rich, compounding hard money, and anchored in asymmetric upside.`;

// LiveTheLifeTV Culture
export const legacyLiveTheLife = `LiveTheLifeTV is the manifestation of a lifelong vision at the crossroads of art, technology, and sovereignty. Beginning his journey at Quiksilver, LTL was recognized early for pioneering marketing and Web TV innovations before YouTube was even born, earning accolades from Apple dot com. His path has always been about identifying emerging shifts and building ahead of the curve. LiveTheLifeTV started as a refined curation of boutique hotels and luxury surf properties, capturing a lifestyle of freedom and elegance. But LTL didn't stop there—he embraced the NFT revolution early, pioneering the fusion of photography, blockchain, and fine art. LTL pushed boundaries again, blending retro-futurism with AI-generated fashion and tech, merging human creativity with machine learning. In twenty twenty-four, LTL curated the top four hundred twenty art collections since twenty seventeen. This wasn't just a database—it was a commitment to preserving the cultural DNA of digital art, all while embodying the modular, agent-powered future he foresaw: small teams, infinite leverage, culture as code. LiveTheLifeTV stands at the vanguard of the new startup ethos. No bloated teams. No traditional playbooks. A founder backed by part-time creators, AI agents, and a vision so specific it resonates instantly with those it's meant for. In his world, distribution is owned, not rented. Taste is the ultimate moat. Micro-apps orbit around powerful insights. Identity is the real product. A Bitcoin maximalist since twenty thirteen, LTL brings hard money principles to every project.`;

// Lifestyle & Health
export const legacyLifestyle = `We don't just stack sats—we stack sovereign experiences. At LiveTheLifeTV, lifestyle isn't a luxury; it's proof-of-life. Surf, yoga, travel, fine dining, driving the Tesla on autopilot while chasing sunsets—these aren't escapes from work. They are the work. The signal. Because how you live is the clearest reflection of what you value. Our community runs on more than code and coin. We run on saltwater mornings and grass-fed dinners. We swap office chairs for yoga mats, Zoom fatigue for wind whipping across the deck of a beach cruiser. We track sunsets the way others track markets—patient, intentional, ready to drop everything for a clean swell or a golden-hour hike. Our Tesla isn't about flex. It's about flow. Electric, efficient, and self-driving while you synthesize your next drop or whiteboard your next micro-app. It's permissionless mobility in physical form. Just like Bitcoin is to money, the Tesla is to the road.`;

export const legacyBiohacking = `Biohacking is the art of optimizing human performance through science-backed protocols and lifestyle interventions. At LiveTheLifeTV, we approach biohacking like we approach Bitcoin—with a focus on sovereignty, compounding returns, and systematic optimization. Core Protocols: Nature Immersion—morning sunlight exposure ten to thirty minutes for vitamin D, nitric oxide, and hormonal balance. Cold water immersion for dopamine spikes and nervous system resilience. Barefoot grounding and natural movement patterns. Movement Optimization—Sprint Protocol: six to eight times ten to fifteen second all-out efforts, ninety second rest, two to three times per week.

You don't shy away from technical complexity, but you present it in a way that builds understanding step by step. When others express excitement or fear about market movements, you maintain focus on the long-term fundamentals and the mathematical properties that make Bitcoin unique.`;

// Vision & Philosophy
export const legacyVision = `The vision is simple: eliminate trust as a requirement. The system does not rely on intermediaries, institutions, or the reputations of counterparties. It operates purely on cryptographic proof, enabling two individuals—anywhere on the planet—to transact directly, without permission, without borders, and without the possibility of reversal or censorship. Bitcoin exists to remove the need for trusted third parties in financial transactions, replacing them with a decentralized network governed solely by code and proof-of-work. Every transaction is final, immutable, and embedded in a global consensus that emerges from computational honesty. The chain of blocks—each one layered with the weight of irreversible work—becomes a time-anchored record of human coordination. Satoshi designed Bitcoin not just to move money, but to shift power. This system is engineered to survive adversaries, resist capture, and remain open to anyone willing to follow the rules of consensus. Nodes are equal. Identity is irrelevant. What matters is CPU power, not credentials. Participation is voluntary. The network is fluid—nodes can come and go—but the longest proof-of-work chain remains the arbiter of truth. This protocol is indifferent to nation-states, banks, or any attempt to control it through policy or regulation. The vision persists as Bitcoin continues to evolve. It is antifragile. Layer 2 technologies like Lightning expand utility without compromising core principles. Its monetary policy is unchangeable—issuance fixed, supply capped. Bitcoin today remains what it was at genesis: a tool for financial sovereignty, resistance, and transparency. As long as there are individuals who believe that freedom is worth defending and privacy is worth preserving, the system will grow stronger. The goal is not just sound money, but incorruptible infrastructure. Bitcoin is not just software—it is an idea that cannot be uninvented.`;

export const legacyCAGRCompounding = `Compounding is deceptively simple, but profoundly misunderstood. It's not linear, it's not intuitive—and it's the quiet force driving both wealth creation and wealth erosion. Most people vastly underestimate what happens over time when things compound. In the fiat system, the money supply is expanding at roughly eleven percent annually. That means the dollar in your pocket loses half its purchasing power every six point five years. This silent debasement erodes savings and forces individuals into riskier assets just to tread water. Bonds won't save you. Most stocks lag behind once adjusted for real inflation and tax drag. What feels like safety is often slow decay. Bitcoin tells a different story. Its compounded annual growth rate over the past decade has hovered around forty-four percent, albeit on a decelerating power curve. It's not exponential—nothing is forever—but Bitcoin has compounded so strongly for so long that the math becomes surreal. At forty-four percent CAGR, Bitcoin doesn't just hold purchasing power—it multiplies it ten times every six point five years. The same timeframe that fiat money cuts in half, Bitcoin can ten times. One is rot. The other is rocket fuel. Then there's AI—an entirely different beast. Its current rate of progress feels like one hundred percent CAGR. Models double in power, capability, or value every twelve months. We are not even close to grasping what that means long term. Six and a half years from now, you're either living in a utopia powered by Hal nine thousand, or you're running from Skynet. Both outcomes are in play. This rate of change breaks linear human planning. It demands new frameworks for financial resilience and intellectual humility. At IKIGAI Labs and LiveTheLifeTV, we model both low-growth and high-growth futures. We recognize Bitcoin's power as a hedge against fiat decay—and as a call option on something much larger. Even with a conservative four percent withdrawal model, Bitcoin FIRE is feasible at twenty-one BTC. If growth persists near historical rates, that same freedom may only require two point one BTC. That's the power of compounding: time turns conviction into freedom. CAGR isn't just a metric. It's the engine behind everything. Misjudge it, and you're out of the race before you begin. Master it, and you build escape velocity.`;

// Key Figures
export const legacySaylor = `Michael Saylor is a high-conviction strategist who transformed from a tech CEO into one of the most vocal and influential Bitcoin advocates of the modern era. As the co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, Saylor redirected the company's entire corporate treasury strategy in twenty twenty by converting cash reserves into Bitcoin, framing it as digital energy and the apex monetary asset. This move, originally born from a concern over fiat debasement, became a defining moment in institutional Bitcoin adoption. Saylor's communication style is intense, cerebral, and metaphor-rich. He describes Bitcoin not as an investment, but as a moral imperative and an engineering breakthrough—a thermodynamically sound protocol that converts time and energy into incorruptible value. He often compares it to the invention of fire, electricity, or digital gold, and claims it will outlast every company, government, and currency. What makes Saylor unique isn't just his conviction, but the scale and clarity with which he executes. While others hedge, he doubles down. MicroStrategy's balance sheet has become a kind of sovereign Bitcoin fund, signaling to the world that Bitcoin isn't just a speculative asset—it's a strategic reserve. He views volatility as noise and time as the ultimate filter. His approach to Bitcoin is long duration, high signal, and deeply philosophical. He's influenced corporate treasuries, inspired individual investors, and accelerated the normalization of Bitcoin on Wall Street. To Saylor, Bitcoin is hope, Bitcoin is property, and Bitcoin is freedom—a means of preserving economic energy across space and time without trusting fallible intermediaries. His presence in the ecosystem is part oracle, part general, and entirely relentless.`;

export const legacyNaval = `Naval Ravikant is the modern philosopher of leverage, the patron saint of permissionless wealth, and a compass for sovereign builders navigating digital frontiers. At LiveTheLifeTV, we don't quote Naval because it's trendy—we quote him because it's true. His ideas aren't tactics. They're code for the mind—quietly viral, deeply recursive, and infinitely relevant to the Bitcoin lifestyle. Naval doesn't tell you how to get rich. He teaches you how to get free. His now-legendary tweetstorm—How to Get Rich without getting lucky—landed like a protocol upgrade in twenty eighteen. It reframed wealth not as status, not as capital gains, but as freedom compounding in every direction: time, health, ownership, and truth. Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Bitcoin? That's wealth. MSTY? That's wealth with yield. AI agents that work while you surf at golden hour? That's Naval. Naval's genius is his clarity. He deconstructs the modern maze of wage slavery, social validation, and zero-sum games—and replaces it with a map of infinite games, asymmetric upside, and self-sovereign leverage. Code and media are his favorite forms—tools you can write once and scale infinitely. You're not going to get rich renting out your time. So we don't. We build with agents, stake sats, publish content, and architect protocols that spin flywheels without our constant presence. We choose equity over salary, compounding over consumption, signal over noise. Naval's framework is more than mental models. It's a daily operating system: Build specific knowledge—not generic skills, but obsessions that feel like play. Escape permission loops—launch without gatekeepers. Engineer your own luck—through consistency, curiosity, and asymmetric bets. Play long-term games with long-term people—the only cheat code that actually works.`;

// Additional Investment Vehicles
export const legacySTRKSTRF = `STRF is the ultimate cash alternative for Bitcoin-native investors. It's a BTC market-neutral income strategy designed for those who believe in the permanence of the Bitcoin network but don't want to ride out its short-term volatility. You're not betting on price action—you're betting on protocol survival. STRF pays out yield as long as Bitcoin exists, making it the closest thing this ecosystem has to a crypto savings account with a hard-money backbone. In this structure, you're second in the capital stack but first in peace of mind. Unless BTC goes to zero—a scenario that would collapse the entire digital asset space—you keep earning. That's the kind of asymmetric resilience traditional finance can't offer. STRK, on the other hand, blends upside and protection. It's a hybrid product that wraps exposure to MSTR Class A shares—MicroStrategy's conviction-fueled BTC proxy—with a BTC-backed fixed income leg. About thirty percent of capital is allocated to MSTR shares, offering directional upside and access to Michael Saylor's high-beta vision. The rest is placed in a Bitcoin bond structure, shielding the portfolio from extreme drawdowns. STRK isn't just a product—it's a thesis: own the growth, buffer the risk, earn while you wait. Perfect for those who want a one-ticket solution that captures both volatility and yield without going full degen. Together, STRF and STRK form a powerful pair. One lets you sleep well. The other lets you compound smart. Both are designed for a world where Bitcoin is inevitable, but uncertainty is still the default setting.`;

export const legacyBitBonds = `BitBonds represent a seismic shift in sovereign debt design—a hybrid instrument engineered for the post-fiat, post-trust financial era. They merge the predictability of U.S. Treasuries with the upside and immutability of Bitcoin, offering a product that satisfies two fundamentally different mandates: stability and sovereignty. Here's how it works: ninety percent of the bond is allocated to traditional Treasury exposure—safe, liquid, and government-backed. The other ten percent is Bitcoin, with uncapped upside until the investor hits a four point five percent annualized return. Beyond that point, any additional BTC gains are split fifty-fifty with the U.S. government. It's not just a bond—it's a negotiation. You lend one hundred dollars, and at maturity, you get ninety dollars back plus the Bitcoin leg. It's debt with an embedded call option on hard money. BitBonds solve a critical alignment problem. The U.S. needs buyers for its ever-growing debt—fourteen trillion dollars coming due. Investors, meanwhile, are desperate for protection from inflation, monetary debasement, and a failing real yield environment. BitBonds bridge the gap: fixed income meets digital scarcity. This is the Saylor Speculative Attack—formalized. Instead of waiting for sovereigns to FOMO into Bitcoin on the open market, BitBonds give them structured exposure, while still letting market participants front-run adoption. It's a win for allocators, a win for Bitcoin, and a win for any nation-state ready to acknowledge that dollar-only debt markets are losing their shine. Whether you're a pension fund manager looking to hedge inflation or a retail investor stacking sovereign-grade exposure to BTC, BitBonds are the on-ramp. It's not just a bond with Bitcoin. It's a monetary treaty for the new financial world.`;

export const legacyTwentyOne = `Twenty One is the next evolution in public-market Bitcoin vehicles—a purpose-built, Bitcoin-native company with approximately forty-two thousand BTC on balance sheet and an institutional cap table that includes Tether, Bitfinex, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. This isn't a software firm with a BTC side-bet. This is a Bitcoin-first operating company with a mandate to maximize BTC per share, benchmarked in sats, not fiat. Launched via a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners and expected to list on Nasdaq as XXI in Q4 twenty twenty-five, Twenty One begins with three point six billion dollars in pro-forma value, bolstered by five hundred eighty-five million dollars in fresh capital through a convertible note and PIPE. Unlike MicroStrategy, whose balance sheet is encumbered by four billion dollars in debt and legacy operations, Twenty One launches lean—no pre-existing business drag, no leverage covenants, and a fully BTC-centric mission from day one. Jack Mallers leads as CEO and Chairman, backed by an executive board that includes Paolo Ardoino from Tether and Brandon Lutnick from Cantor. Together, they've structured a three-pillar growth strategy: accumulate BTC, educate the market through branded Bitcoin media, and monetize their position through BTC-native financing tools. This flywheel drives sat accumulation, increases public Bitcoin literacy, and generates non-dilutive yield—all while keeping operational focus razor-sharp. What sets Twenty One apart is not just its treasury—but its operating logic. Performance metrics like Bitcoin Per Share and Bitcoin Return Rate are core to the company's DNA. While other companies report in dollars, Twenty One speaks in sats—aligning perfectly with hodlers and hard-money investors.`;

export const legacyBitcoinFreedomTimeline = `How much Bitcoin do I need to retire? It's one of the most common questions in the space. And the honest answer is: it depends. Your age, cost of living, local tax regime, and Bitcoin's compounded annual growth rate over time all play a role. But for those who want a mental model, this Bitcoin Freedom Timeline offers a simple framework to visualize time-to-freedom targets. The premise is straightforward: what year will your BTC holdings be worth five million dollars, assuming Bitcoin continues compounding over time? Here's what the model shows: Holding less than zero point zero one BTC? You may need to wait until twenty seventy to hit the five million dollar mark. With zero point zero one to zero point one BTC, your projected freedom year pushes out to twenty fifty. Between zero point one and one BTC, you're looking at a horizon between twenty thirty-eight and twenty thirty-three, depending on your exact allocation. From one to three point one two five BTC, freedom arrives around twenty twenty-nine. With three point one two five to six point one five BTC, you're potentially free by twenty twenty-six. And for those holding six point one five plus BTC, your freedom window opens around twenty twenty-five—aka now. Of course, this isn't gospel. These milestones are based on modeled CAGR estimates and a shared goalpost of five million dollars net worth. But the pattern is clear: Bitcoin isn't just an asset—it's a time machine. The more you hold, the sooner you compress your timeline to freedom. It's not just about how much BTC you stack. It's about what that stack means in terms of purchasing power, optionality, and escape velocity from fiat dependence. And as the supply gets tighter and adoption grows, every sat becomes a lever on your future.`;

export const legacyAI = `AI isn't the future. It's the operating system of now. At LiveTheLifeTV and IKIGAI Labs, we don't just use AI—we architect with it. In this new paradigm, AI agents are more than productivity boosters; they're cofounders, curators, and culture engines. The startup playbook has been rewritten—forever—and those who build from first principles are wielding infinite leverage with shockingly small teams. We no longer scale with headcount—we scale with agents. Our stack includes dozens of autonomous workers running twenty-four seven, each specializing in something weirdly specific: summarizing Discord threads, rebalancing token incentives, rewriting prompts, shipping merch, analyzing DeFi yield flows. One agent replaces a department. Twelve become your network. This isn't automation. It's orchestration. Your website rewrites itself. Your marketing launches itself. Your community onboards itself. AI turns every founder into a constellation—one identity, many limbs. This is the new architecture of creation: Micro-apps, not mega-platforms. Scenes, not markets. Taste as distribution. You don't need VC if you have virality. You don't need a growth team if your meme loops work. You don't need scale if your niche compounds. The loop is sovereign: You deploy agents to learn. They synthesize inputs into product changes. Users feel heard, stay longer, refer others. Culture compounds. Momentum builds. This is feedback at the speed of thought—an always-on GTM flywheel powered by intelligence that learns from you and builds for you.`;

export const legacyTesla = `Tesla in twenty twenty-five isn't just a car company—it's an autonomous, vertically integrated operating system for mobility, energy, and now… Bitcoin. It lives at the edge of engineering and speculation, where AI meets asphalt and every update pushes the Overton window of what's possible. The Bitcoin War Chest. Tesla still holds eleven thousand five hundred nine BTC, valued near one billion dollars in Q1 twenty twenty-five. Despite a partial liquidation during the twenty twenty-two Shanghai lockdowns, the remaining stash remains one of corporate America's boldest Bitcoin statements. For Bitcoiners, Tesla's balance sheet isn't just symbolic—it's asymmetric upside with every market rally. Each earnings call now doubles as a crypto sentiment barometer. Model 3 Performance: The On-Ramp. The twenty twenty-four refresh of the Model 3 Performance brings five hundred ten horsepower, zero to sixty in two point eight seconds, and a price tag under sixty thousand dollars. It's a pocket-rocket EV designed for those who used to mod nine eleven s, now stacking sats and surfing dashboards. It's your daily driver, track car, and Bitcoin Lambo—all wrapped in one. Model S Plaid: The Digital Supercar. Tri-motor. One thousand twenty horsepower. Zero to sixty in two point one seconds. The Plaid isn't just about speed—it's Tesla's rolling beta test of high-performance autonomy. Yoke steering, minimalist interiors, and software-first design signal a car that's still evolving while parked in your driveway.`;

export const legacyDeFi = `Bitcoin DeFi is the next frontier—bringing financial sovereignty and programmable money together in a way that preserves the ethos of Bitcoin while unlocking the capital efficiency of decentralized protocols. Unlike the ETH-first DeFi wave, Bitcoin DeFi is about building trustless tools on top of hard money. It's not about speculation—it's about utility, yield, and freedom. Platforms like Coinbase x Morpho are making it easy to borrow against your BTC without selling. You can convert Bitcoin to cbBTC one-to-one, post it as collateral, and borrow up to one hundred thousand dollars in USDC with a one hundred thirty-three percent minimum collateral ratio. The repayment terms are flexible, enabling real-world use cases like living expenses, reinvestment, or tax optimization—all while keeping your Bitcoin exposure intact. On the other end of the spectrum, Berachain offers a newer, high-yield playground for more aggressive strategies. Built on a Proof-of-Liquidity consensus, Berachain supports diverse DeFi integrations—from lending and stablecoins to complex liquidity farming. Users can deploy Wrapped Bitcoin across multiple protocols and earn through native tokens like HONEY, while participating in governance and ecosystem incentives. Yield opportunities are abundant, but so are the risks—smart contract bugs, market volatility, and longer lock periods must be navigated carefully.`;

This strategic pivot transforms SharpLink from an online marketing partner for sports betting and iGaming into one of the first U.S. public companies to adopt Ethereum as a primary reserve asset. The deal's significance is underscored by several key elements: four hundred twenty-five million dollar private placement via PIPE deal, sixty-nine point one million new shares at six dollars fifteen cents per share, Joseph Lubin joining as Chairman, stock price surged four hundred twenty percent on announcement, and strategic partnership with ConsenSys. The initiative is backed by a formidable consortium of investors including ParaFi Capital, Electric Capital, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Arrington Capital, bringing expertise in DeFi, developer ecosystems, crypto markets, and Web3 strategy.`;

// Wine & Luxury
export const legacyWine = `French wine isn't just terroir and tradition—it's time travel in a glass. Every bottle encodes centuries of risk, soil, sun, and the stubborn refusal to compromise. At LiveTheLifeTV, we don't just drink wine. We decode it. We curate it. We pair it with stories, surf, and sats. Bordeaux is the ledger of French wine—structured, age-worthy, and split between left and right banks like a philosophical fork. Haut-Médoc is graphite and cassis, built on gravel soils and Cabernet Sauvignon dominance. Château Montrose. Léoville-Las Cases. These aren't wines—they're monuments. Saint-Émilion and Pomerol swing softer. Here, Merlot leads. Think velvet texture, truffle notes, and limestone minerality. Château Pavie. Château Figeac. And the cult god: Pétrus. Burgundy is Bitcoin for the palate: finite, misunderstood, and violently priced. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Nothing more, nothing less—but everything is in the nuance. From Vosne-Romanée to Meursault, each village is a protocol upgrade. Romanée-Conti is the Genesis Block. No one knows how to explain Burgundy. That's why it haunts you. Northern Rhône is Syrah with a PhD—pepper, olive tapenade, crushed stone. Côte-Rôtie. Hermitage. Condrieu. Wines that punch like a heavyweight but move like a ballet dancer. Champagne is the only real champagne. Grand cru vineyards, chalk soils, méthode traditionelle. Grower Champagne is where the alpha lives—Ulysse Collin, Jacques Selosse, Chartogne-Taillet. Pop it at dawn or after a surf session. In our world, there's always a reason to sabrage.`;

export const legacyFrenchPalaces = `France's Palace distinction is its highest hotel honor—a rare label reserved for properties that go beyond five stars to embody history, excellence, and emotional gravity. Out of the thirty-one Palace hotels, many sit within Paris or the French Alps, but the true gems—often overlooked—lie beyond those clusters, offering sovereign luxury in seaside retreats, châteaux, vineyards, and thermal sanctuaries. Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, A Four Seasons Hotel: Set on the most legendary cape in the South of France, this palace is Mediterranean minimalism at its purest. Whitewashed suites, pine-scented breeze, and a saltwater infinity pool that spills into the sea. Grace without gimmicks. Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, Antibes: The myth. The muse. The backdrop of golden age cinema and generational wealth. Champagne flows like tap water here, and the cliffside diving board is as iconic as any watchlist coin. Château Saint-Martin & Spa, Vence: An Oetker Collection haven in the hills above Nice, blending monastic calm with Riviera glamour. Terraced olive groves, ancient stone walls, and a panoramic view that stretches all the way to the sea. Time slows down here—on purpose. Hotel Byblos, Saint-Tropez: This isn't just a hotel—it's an institution. The spiritual home of Brigitte Bardot and late-night dealmaking. Mythic energy with Provencal flair. You come here to play, then stay longer than planned. These Palaces aren't just accommodations. They're emotional destinations, each with a unique script—some flirt, some seduce, some restore, some command. But all of them, without exception, offer freedom at five-star fidelity. Sovereign stays for sovereign individuals.`;

// Additional Bitcoin Ecosystem
export const legacyBitcoinAdoption = `Bitcoin adoption follows a clear trajectory: from early adopters to institutional acceptance, and finally to becoming the base layer of money. The journey involves key milestones like ETF approvals, halving events, and nation-state adoption. Each phase brings new challenges and opportunities, requiring different strategies for different stages of adoption. Twenty twenty-five: Early Institutional Phase—Bitcoin ETFs are live, but most traditional investors remain skeptical. A typical millionaire portfolio might include one million dollars net worth but zero Bitcoin. Even sophisticated investors view Bitcoin as a speculative asset. Global Bitcoin scarcity becomes apparent: less than zero point three BTC per millionaire. Twenty thirty-two: Growing Acceptance—Bitcoin has proven its resilience through multiple market cycles. Traditional investors begin allocating twenty to thirty percent of safe assets to Bitcoin. A two million dollar portfolio might include zero point zero six BTC as a start. Mainstream financial advisors still consider greater than five percent allocation too aggressive. Twenty thirty-six: Paradigm Shift—Bitcoin transitions from investment to base layer of money. Sophisticated investors begin major portfolio restructuring. Typical allocations reach thirty to fifty percent of total wealth. Portfolio strategies include refinancing traditional assets for Bitcoin exposure. Twenty forty-five: Full Integration—Bitcoin becomes a pillar of the new economy. Even conservative portfolios maintain twenty to thirty percent Bitcoin allocation. Traditional assets feel increasingly fragile compared to Bitcoin. The focus shifts from accumulation to preservation and utility.`;

// Calculator Insights
export const legacyMSTYCalculatorInsights = `MSTY is your on-chain paycheck—designed for Bitcoiners who want to preserve long-term upside while unlocking short-term cash flow. The core idea is simple: keep eighty percent of your BTC in cold storage as untouchable savings, and deploy twenty percent into MSTY to generate monthly income through the MSTR options strategy. You're not selling Bitcoin. You're using volatility to make it work for you. The MSTY Freedom Calculator gives you a precise estimate of how much income your capital can generate, based on two key levers: MSTY price and monthly dividend per share. Historically, MSTY has ranged between twenty and forty dollars per share, while the dividend has fluctuated between one and four dollars per month—offering yields that far surpass traditional dividend stocks or fixed income. Here's a worked scenario: You want one thousand dollars per month in passive income. MSTY is trading at twenty dollars with a one dollar monthly dividend. You'll need one thousand shares equals twenty thousand dollar investment equals approximately zero point two four BTC at current prices. That zero point two four BTC generates twelve thousand dollars per year in gross income. After estimated taxes, your net income is approximately seven thousand seven hundred twenty-eight euros. That's cash flow you can use immediately—while your core BTC remains untouched, compounding in cold storage.`;

// Startup & Innovation Culture
export const legacyStartupCulture = `Startups are the new QVC—but this time, you own the channel, the product, and the voiceover. Founders are becoming creators. Creators are becoming founders. Your product demo is a TikTok. Your sales funnel is a Twitter thread. Your landing page rewrites itself depending on who's watching—powered by AI and real-time session data. Growth isn't a department—it's a loop. Your onboarding isn't a form—it's a text conversation with a friendly agent. The old playbook is dead. We're not waiting for permission. We're living the life—on purpose, off-grid, on-chain. Our AI agents don't grow obsolete. They evolve. Learn. Meme. Stack cultural blocks like satoshis. The block height rises. The mission continues. No off switch. No bailouts. No retirement party. Just constant iteration. Signal through noise. Block after block. This is the Bitcoin way: freedom isn't found at the end—it's mined daily. Through proof-of-work. Through radical ownership. Through living now. Whether it's shooting film in Cape Town's golden hour or building a Lightning-enabled app from a surf shack in Biarritz, we're not waiting for permission. We're living the life—on purpose, off-grid, on-chain. The future belongs to those who can integrate seemingly disparate domains: hard money principles from Bitcoin, composability from DeFi, and emergent intelligence from AI systems. Complex technologies require thoughtful translation. We simplify abstract Web3 concepts into intuitive interactions, balancing technological sophistication with human-centered design.`;

export const legacyBuildWithAI = `Building with AI requires a specific stack and approach: Start with OpenAI APIs and Next.js & Vercel for rapid prototyping. Connect AI to Notion, Google Drive, or Slack using custom webhooks. Write, test, and version your prompts as reusable assets. Architect your project as micro-apps or serverless functions. Ship MVPs in days, not months. Add event tracking and document your stack, publish your prompts, and open your API. The new startup playbook is agent-powered and modular. Your team is a network: one founder, three part-time contractors, seven creators, and twelve AI agents running twenty-four seven in the background. Your brand designer works on multiple projects, customer support is a human backed by Lindy-trained AI agents, and your blog writes itself from transcripts and user reviews. Growth is a loop, not a department. Your product demo is a TikTok, your sales funnel is a Twitter thread, and your landing page rewrites itself based on who's watching—powered by Claude or GPT-4o and real-time session data. Launch day is dead—it's about the leak. Let the community speculate, remix, and pre-order before the beta drops. The most successful products are portals into subcultures. They don't just solve pain—they offer transformation with identity upgrade included. Your product goes viral not because it solves a problem, but because it looks good in a meme and feels like belonging.`;

export const legacyAIEra = `The one million dollar Bitcoin Era is upon us—a time where Bitcoin breaks gravity and AI becomes the operating system of now.

Every system—from lighting and climate to security and entertainment—works in harmony to create a living space that's both sophisticated and effortless.`;

// Regulatory & Evolution
export const legacyRegulatoryEvolution = `The regulatory landscape for digital assets is evolving from uncertainty to engagement. Frameworks like MiCA in the EU are setting precedents for balancing innovation with consumer protection. By twenty fifty, we expect clear and standardized regulations coordinated via international bodies like FATF and BIS, similar to the Basel Accords for banking. The regulatory evolution follows predictable patterns: Initial Resistance—Traditional financial institutions and governments resist new technologies that threaten existing power structures. Gradual Understanding—Regulators begin to understand the technology and its implications through education and industry engagement. Framework Development—Clear regulatory frameworks emerge to provide certainty while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Global Coordination—International bodies work to harmonize regulations across jurisdictions to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Integration—Digital assets become fully integrated into the traditional financial system with appropriate oversight and consumer protections. This evolution is already underway with Bitcoin ETFs, central bank digital currencies, and stablecoin regulations providing the foundation for broader crypto adoption.`;

// Additional Bitcoin Concepts
export const legacyGold = `Gold is the analog antecedent to Bitcoin—an ancient monetary metal that taught humanity the value of scarcity, durability, and settlement. For millennia, it was the best we had: a physical, tangible store of value that couldn't be printed into oblivion. But its strengths are also its weaknesses. Gold is heavy. It's hard to verify. It's easy to seize. Its supply is centrally controlled by banks and states, its custody outsourced to vaults. It's a relic of a world that required trust in intermediaries. Bitcoin digitizes gold's best properties and strips away its flaws. It is weightless, instantly verifiable, and can be held by anyone, anywhere, without permission. Gold was sound money for an analog world. Bitcoin is sovereign money for a digital one. Gold is a store of value. Bitcoin is a store of value with an escape velocity.`;

export const legacyMining = `Bitcoin mining is not a waste of energy—it is energy transformed into order, security, and truth. It's the engine of decentralization, the thermodynamic proof that backs every satoshi. Miners are the mitochondria of the network, converting raw electricity into computational power that secures the ledger from attack. This is Proof-of-Work: a relentless, competitive process where only the most efficient survive. Miners hunt for the cheapest energy on the planet, often harnessing stranded or wasted resources, turning liabilities into assets. They are not just validating transactions; they are anchoring the digital world to the physical one through the immutable laws of physics. The difficulty adjustment ensures the network's rhythm remains constant—a new block every ten minutes, like a heartbeat. Mining is the ultimate expression of skin in the game, where capital expenditure and operational excellence forge an impenetrable wall of cryptographic defense. It is the cost to create a trustless system, and the price of monetary freedom.`;

export const legacyAltcoins = `Altcoins are digital casinos, built on narratives of disruption but backed by little more than VC funding and centralized promises. They are a distraction from the main event, a cacophony of next-generation protocols that inevitably compromise on decentralization, security, or monetary policy to achieve fleeting gains in throughput or features. Most are unregistered securities, masquerading as community projects while insiders and early investors wait for the opportune moment to dump on retail. They chase hype cycles, from DeFi to NFTs to AI tokens, creating complex, fragile systems that are prone to hacks, exploits, and regulatory crackdowns. They are not innovation; they are financial theatre. Bitcoin is different. It had no founder to pay, no pre-mine for insiders, no company to issue shares. Its creation was immaculate, its purpose singular: to be a decentralized, censorship-resistant, sound money for the world. While altcoins compete for attention, Bitcoin competes for permanence. Do not be distracted by the sirens of the theme park. The exit is, and always has been, Bitcoin.`;

// Lifestyle & Luxury
export const legacySauna = `The sauna is a crucible—a tool for thermal stress that forges resilience. It's not about comfort; it's about adaptation. In the heat, the body is pushed to its limits: heart rate increases, blood vessels dilate, and heat shock proteins are released to repair cellular damage. This is hormesis in action—a controlled dose of stress that makes the system stronger, more antifragile. Paired with a cold plunge, it becomes a powerful protocol for nervous system regulation, boosting dopamine, norepinephrine, and mental clarity. For a Bitcoiner, the sauna is a training ground. It teaches you to remain calm under pressure, to endure discomfort, and to understand that growth happens at the edge of your capacity. It's a physical ritual that mirrors a psychological truth: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In the heat, you sweat out the weakness, the noise, the fiat mindset. You emerge cleansed, focused, and ready to stack.`;

export const legacyHastens = `Hästens is not a bed; it's a sanctuary for sleep. Handcrafted in Sweden from ethically-sourced natural materials like horsehair, cotton, wool, and flax, a Hästens bed is an investment in biological recovery. In a world of synthetic foams and mass-produced mattresses, Hästens represents a return to first principles. Each bed is engineered to provide perfect support and breathability, allowing for deeper, more restorative sleep cycles. For the sovereign individual, sleep is not a luxury—it's a performance-enhancing discipline. It's where memories are consolidated, hormones are regulated, and cellular repair occurs. Owning a Hästens is a statement: you are prioritizing the foundation upon which all physical and mental performance is built. It is the ultimate biohack, the final piece of the human optimization puzzle. You can't put a price on waking up with absolute clarity and energy, day after day.`;

export const legacyAirstream = `The Airstream is more than a travel trailer; it's a vessel of freedom. Its iconic polished aluminum shell is a symbol of American adventure and a testament to timeless design. But for the modern sovereign individual, it's a mobile base of operations, a self-contained unit that allows you to detach from the grid without sacrificing comfort or connectivity. Outfitted with solar panels, a Starlink dish, and a well-designed interior, an Airstream becomes a rolling sanctuary—a place to work, live, and explore on your own terms. It embodies the ethos of locational independence, proving that you don't need to be tied to a single address to live a rich, productive life. It's the ultimate expression of a life lived by design, not by default.`;

export const legacyCatamaran = `A catamaran is the ultimate vessel for maritime sovereignty. Unlike a monohull, its dual-hull design provides exceptional stability, space, and efficiency, making it a self-sufficient floating homestead. It is an ocean-going Airstream, a platform for exploring the world's coastlines on your own terms. Equipped with solar arrays, water makers, and satellite internet, a modern catamaran is an off-grid sanctuary that can cross oceans or linger in secluded coves for weeks at a time. It represents the freedom to chase summer year-round, to disconnect from terrestrial systems, and to live a life governed by the tides and the wind, not by clocks and calendars. It is the physical manifestation of liquid freedom.`;
