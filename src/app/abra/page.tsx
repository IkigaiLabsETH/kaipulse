      q: "What are Bitcoin-backed loans?",
      a: (
        <span>
          Bitcoin-backed loans allow Bitcoin holders to borrow cash while keeping their BTC holdings. Instead of selling Bitcoin, users can use it as collateral to access liquidity. This is particularly valuable for Bitcoin maximalists who want to maintain their position while accessing cash for other needs. The loans are overcollateralized, meaning you must deposit more Bitcoin than the cash value you want to borrow, providing a safety margin against price volatility.

          ‚Ä¢ Custody: Strike uses third-party lenders vs. Abra uses Fireblocks directly

                Bitcoin holders (&quot;HODLers&quot;) often face a dilemma when they need cash: sell a prized Bitcoin stash (and potentially miss out on future gains) or find a way to borrow against it. In 2025, Bitcoin-backed loans have re-emerged as a hot topic, with high-profile figures like Jack Mallers of Strike pushing new borrowing products at major industry events. Meanwhile, veteran crypto company Abra has been quietly offering an alternative lending model to private clients, boasting significantly lower rates and a regulated structure.

                  Abra offers lower rates (5-6% vs 12%) but charges a 2% origination fee. Strike has no fees but higher interest. Abra&apos;s open-term loans provide more flexibility than Strike&apos;s 12-month terms. Both platforms avoid rehypothecation and maintain segregated accounts.

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                  Strike&apos;s 50% LTV provides more safety margin than Abra&apos;s 75% LTV. Abra&apos;s SEC registration offers regulatory oversight, while Strike relies on partner relationships. Both platforms implement strong security measures and transparency practices.

                <p className="text-lg">
                  Abra has a longer track record in lending and survived the 2022 crypto winter. Strike brings fresh innovation and Bitcoin-native focus. Both platforms have earned trust in different ways - Abra through regulation and history, Strike through its Bitcoin community presence.
