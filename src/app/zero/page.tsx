Work for decades, defer happiness, and hope to be free‚Ä¶ someday.

                There&apos;s a silent killer in the crypto world‚Äîand no, it&apos;s not market volatility. It&apos;s ego disguised as strategy. It&apos;s the belief that what worked for your $10K portfolio will still work when you&apos;re managing $1M or more.

                Like many others, I got into crypto during the wild west era. Back then, taking big swings felt like the right move‚Äîand in many ways, it was. When your entire bankroll is $1,000 or even $10,000, going down 50% isn&apos;t life-ruining. It stings, but it doesn&apos;t change the trajectory of your life. You can rebuild. You&apos;re not gambling your family&apos;s future or your peace of mind. You&apos;re risking a small stack to chase asymmetric upside.
              </p>

                  If you&apos;ve built up a $1M portfolio, going to $2M will certainly feel great, but it won&apos;t double your quality of life in the way going from $1K to $100K might. Conversely, a catastrophic drawdown that takes you from $1M back down to $50K? That absolutely changes your life.
