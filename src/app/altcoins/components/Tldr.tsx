          Crypto in 2025 is fully mainstream and ruthlessly extractive. Most of CT (Crypto Twitter) is a minefield—shilling, pay-to-post schemes, insider groupchats, and zero real alpha unless you have informational edge. Big accounts rarely offer true value; they&apos;re often running exit liquidity plays or sponsored shills. Airdrop farming is cleaner but dying.

          Don&apos;t idolize. Don&apos;t blindly buy. Read more, trade less. Learn who&apos;s playing what game and why. Build a real network, stay observant, and protect your capital. CT is a dangerous sport—treat it like one.
