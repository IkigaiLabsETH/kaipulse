          Bitcoin&apos;s historical 4-year cycle, dictated by the halving&apos;s supply shock, is losing its predictive power. With each cycle, the halving&apos;s impact shrinks, pushing its significance towards zero. The era of miner sell-offs driving market rhythm is ending. It&apos;s time for a new model.

          This isn&apos;t the same game. The demand side has been supercharged. Spot ETFs have opened the floodgates to unprecedented capital. Sovereign nations and corporations are now building Bitcoin reserves, a trend that&apos;s only just begun. Add a pro-crypto political shift and the most mature tech infrastructure we&apos;ve ever had, and the picture becomes clear.

          Crypto in 2025 is fully mainstream and ruthlessly extractive. Most of CT (Crypto Twitter) is a minefield—shilling, pay-to-post schemes, insider groupchats, and zero real alpha unless you have informational edge. Big accounts rarely offer true value; they&apos;re often running exit liquidity plays or sponsored shills. Airdrop farming is cleaner but dying. CT is a dangerous sport—treat it like one.
