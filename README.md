# Why "Satsnap" Became KaiPulse

We built Satsnap to prove every "like" could move real Bitcoin, but the name never captured the deeper reason we show up each day. Therefore we're re-branding to **KaiPulse**—a single word that fuses purpose (kai) with motion (pulse).

---

## What kai means

In Japanese, kai (改 / 甲斐) speaks to change, worth, and the "why" that gets you out of bed.
Creators don't post for empty hearts; they post to make an impact. Kai puts that intention front-and-center.

## What pulse adds

A pulse is a heartbeat and an electric spike. It's the Lightning invoice firing 21 sats in 200 milliseconds.
Attention finally travels at the speed of life.

---

## The story in one line

You share something real but it only matters when value moves; therefore every tap now sends a KaiPulse.

## What's changing

| Old         | New                                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Name: Satsnap | Name: KaiPulse                                 |
| Photo-first vibe | Purpose-first, any medium                  |
| Yellow flash logo | Iconic bolt-swoosh in cinematic Tarantino yellow |
| "Like → 21 sats" | Pulse any action—likes, follows, AI prompts |

## What stays the same
- Bitcoin Lightning rails — instant, borderless, final.
- 21-sat default micro-reward — tweakable, still magic.
- No tokens, no ads, no middlemen — ever.

---

## How this benefits you
- Creators earn faster and can price every micro-moment.
- Fans feel the why behind each pulse—gratitude they can measure.
- Builders plug a single API and ride the same heartbeat.

---

## Rollout timeline
- **Today** – New logo and brand live on web, TestFlight, and GitHub.
- **Next Week** – Mobile apps auto-update; your sats and logins remain.
- **Q3** – Pulse-based AI prompts and LTL Maps quests ship under one wallet.

---

## A final note

We loved the scrappy energy of Satsnap, but the future deserves a name that carries weight long after the first novelty fades. Therefore welcome to KaiPulse—purpose in a heartbeat.

See you on the feed. Charge every moment,
– The KaiPulse (formerly Satsnap) team 🐻

## 🧠 Strategy Layer

### Core Philosophy: Bitcoin-First (80%)
The foundation of our strategy is a significant allocation to cold storage Bitcoin, representing 80% of the total portfolio. This aligns with the principle of self-custody and long-term value preservation.

### Strategic Components

| Asset | Allocation | Role | Tax Treatment | Strategy |
|-------|------------|------|---------------|-----------|
| BTC | 80% | Core Holdings | Capital gains only if sold | Self-custodied in cold storage for long-term preservation of wealth |
| MSTY | 10% | Income Stream | Taxed annually as ordinary income | Generate monthly income through covered call premiums on MSTR |
| MSTR | 10% | Growth | Capital gains only if sold | Additional Bitcoin exposure through corporate treasury strategy |

### Why This Allocation?
- **80% BTC**: Maintains Bitcoin as the primary asset while ensuring self-custody
- **10% MSTY**: Provides steady monthly income without selling core BTC position
- **10% MSTR**: Offers additional Bitcoin exposure with potential corporate advantages
