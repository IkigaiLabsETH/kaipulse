## Core Purpose

**GROK420 and the entire LiveTheLifeTV platform are built around a single mission:**
> **Help you find assets that outperform Bitcoin (BTC).**

Every feature—real-time X (Twitter) sentiment, curated market reports, and daily "gm" briefings—is designed to surface and highlight altcoins, stocks, and narratives that are beating BTC. The system automatically checks and displays which tracked assets are outperforming Bitcoin over multiple timeframes (24h, 7d, YTD, etc.), making BTC outperformance the centerpiece of your daily crypto intelligence and the guiding principle of the site.

**Key Features:**
- 🏆 **BTC Outperformance Detection:** Instantly see which assets are beating Bitcoin, every day.
- 📰 **Narrative-Driven Analysis:** X sentiment and news always highlight the "why" behind outperformance.
- ⏱️ **Flexible Timeframes:** Request 24h, 7d, YTD, or all periods—only fetches extra data if you ask.
- 📈 **Comprehensive Market Coverage:** Real-time prices, altcoins, crypto stocks, macro context, and more.
- 🤖 **Modern AI & Tooling:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Grok 4's real-time X data integration.
- 🔍 **AI-Powered Stock Intelligence:** Automatic detection and live Finnhub data for 50+ prioritized stocks.
- 💰 **Live Financial Data:** Insider sentiment, transactions, earnings, news, and company profiles.
- 🎯 **Smart Query Detection:** Recognizes stock symbols, company names, and common aliases automatically.

**Bottom line:**  
If your goal is to beat Bitcoin, GROK420 and LiveTheLifeTV are your daily edge.

### **🔍 Smart Stock Detection**
- **Automatic Recognition:** Detects 50+ prioritized stocks from your queries
- **Alias Support:** Recognizes "Tesla" → TSLA, "MicroStrategy" → MSTR, "Coinbase" → COIN
- **Natural Language:** Works with casual queries like "What's up with TSLA?" or "Tell me about MicroStrategy"

### **📊 Live Finnhub Data Integration**
- **Insider Sentiment:** Executive buying/selling patterns and MSPR analysis
- **Insider Transactions:** Detailed executive trading activity and net flows
- **Company Earnings:** Quarterly performance, beats/misses, and trends
- **Recent News:** Latest announcements, press releases, and market-moving events
- **Company Profiles:** Fundamentals, financial metrics, and business information

### **🎯 Prioritized Stock Universe**
**Crypto & Tech:** MSTR, COIN, HOOD, NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, CRCL, BLOCK, PYPL
**Bitcoin Mining:** IREN, CORZ, CIFR, RIOT, CLSK, WULF, HUT, MARA, GLXY
**High-Growth:** QBTS, CRSP, RGTI, QUBT, KTOS, DRS, IONQ
**Innovation:** IBM, PLTR, VRTX, REGN, MRNA, LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, BA, TSM
**Nuclear Energy:** CCJ, CEG, ETR, UEC

### **⚡ How It Works**
1. **Query Analysis:** System scans your message for stock mentions
2. **Live Data Fetch:** Parallel API calls to Finnhub for all relevant metrics
3. **Smart Formatting:** Clear sections with emojis, explanations, and insights
4. **Graceful Fallbacks:** Shows available data even if some endpoints fail
